# HREA

Replication code to produce High Resolution Electricity Access indicators.

## About

The High Resolution Electricity Access (HREA) project led by University of Michigan Professor Brian Min aims to provide open access time series indicators of electricity access and reliability across the world.  Electrification metrics are computed via statistical methods utilizing multiple geospatial data sets and nighttime satellite imagery.

## Description

This GitHub repository contains code to recreate HREA output from publicly available inputs.  This repository is currently under development; for previous code, please see the earlier repository at https://github.com/zachokeeffe/nightlight_electrification.
